          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>The Brew Connection is the collaborative idea of 4 friends: Andrew Bell, Nicholas Ochs, Jason Wilger and Crystal Stokes. 
            We all met in school at Digital Crafts and as an idea for a school project, came this site. We thought it would be a great idea to have a site where people who enjoy a good drink, as we do, could locate their closest Brewery, Cidery, Brewpub or Bottleshop.
            Therefore, enjoy the site and we hope you find the perfect place to throw back a drink and have a bite. :&#41

          <h3>Early History of Brewing</h3>
          <p>In Ancient Egypt, as far back as the Predynastic era of 5500-3100 BC, and possibly even further, evidence is found of beer and alcoholic beverages. As most evidence shows, and as recorded by the Greeks, it was the Egyptians who invented beer. 
            Because of the lack of a sewage system, water was a breeding ground for disease. It is because of how unhealthy the water was that people turned to beer. In places where grape vines would not grow, beer was the drink of every man, rich or poor, pharaoh or common-man. 
            Not only did the Egyptians have basic beer brewed from barley, but according to ancient texts, they had “dark beer, iron beer, garnished beer, friend’s beer, and beer of the protector”. These beers would be brewed for special state events and other such holidays. 
            Grains and barley were so big in the Egyptian culture that beer, along with bread or raw grains, was even used as a form of payment. While hops were certainly not used in the beer production and flavoring of ancient Egypt, what is suggested by their texts is that the date palm was used. 
            Although the complete process is not fully understood, due to translation errors, it is assumed by many that fermentation originally took place by accident when germinated grain began to spoil. It is from there that the soon to be brewers must have realized that fermentation is something they could control and eventually would refine the process to create a crude beer. 
            While all of this was taking place in Egypt, in the area between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, brewing of another sort was taking place in Mesopotamia.
            As in ancient Egypt, all Mesopotamian social classes drank beer. Like in Egypt, beer was also tied to religion as well as to medical properties. While there are many documents and pictures, there is not a vast amount of physical evidence of brewing or breweries in Mesopotamian societies, and only one of the three physical sites that were found is in the main land of Mesopotamia; the other two sites are found in Syria. 
            While there isn’t much evidence of large scale brewing, the techniques in Mesopotamia and in Egypt seem to be very similarly tied with bread-making, even though there is also little documentation of actual techniques. Mesopotamian brewers, just as the Egyptians, had concocted several forms of beer, such as “black beer, red beer, barley beer, spelt beer, fine white beer, and fine black beer”. 
            The beer in Mesopotamia was said to be “cloudy and thick”, and if it was unfiltered it was drunk through straws. While most of the straws have deteriorated, pictures inscribed in walls depicting people drinking with straws as well as a golden straw have been found in the Royal Cemetery at an ancient city, Ur. Because of the pictures depicting several people drinking from straws at once rather than just one person, it is assumed that drinking was a social event. 
            In fact, not only was it a social event, but it was a customary sign of a good time; “It was considered to be bad mannered to leave a banquet in an upright position; indeed, this was a sign that the guest had not enjoyed himself.”.</p>
